		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The point of the lab was straightforward, and we were able to complete it fairly quickly. I knew what to do for the JavaScript part with the help of the screenshots, but I'm still wrapping my head around what each aspect does. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> We only had minor issues with this lab, the biggest being trivial .js formatting issues, but my partner knew her way around JavaScript and caught a few formatting mistakes I made, so we didn't run into any major problems thankfully. </p>
	  <h2>Results</h2>
			<p> everything was successful, this was the most straightforward and issue-free lab so far. I feel like usually there ends up being a lot of troubleshooting, but we only ran into a few minor issues that we managed to resolve fairly quickly. </p>
