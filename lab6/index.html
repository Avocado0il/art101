  <h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>For lab 6 we are meant to create a js variables in the console about what we use for trasportation. Then we use that to create a js program and link that to our lab 6 indext.html. A problem that was ran into was me having formatting issues again with my js file causing it to not appear in my index.html file.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results can be seen below with the js output, and this page in general.</p>

         <h2>Script Output</h2>
